# Building a Portfolio: Advanced CSS

## Project Description

I wanted to build a portfolio page which will be used so that I can showcase my skills and talents I learned to future employers. We were supposed to start from scratch and no starter code was given. I was excited for this project as I got to express myself in
any way I wanted to using the tools I had learnt.

> **Note:** I do not have enough web applications to showcase at this point. I will be using placeholder images instead and replacing the images and links in future. I didn't have enough time to complete my project to my fullest ability, which I will be putting some more time into completing this project.

## Tasks

---

- Add a Name, Photo, Links to corresponding sections, My Work (placeholders) and a 'contact me' section.
- A Navigation bar. When clicking the links, the UI scrolls to corresponding sections. (My Work with titles, however I don't have any work to add as of yet.)
- One application should be larger than others
- Clicking on the images, It should take me to the application.
- The website should be responsive and adapt to the viewport.

## The Process: Yasmin Portfolio Website

I worked on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to help me create my page. Here are a series of images to display my thought process and brainstorming process.

## What did I learn?

---

> I learned that being realistic will save you an extremely long time and help you get more work done. I created my own Wireframe and used an app called [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to brainstorm my idea. This will be extremely useful in future when I do have the skillset to acheieve my goals in creating a beautiful and functional website.

## Future Tests (Bugs & Fixes)

---

### Responsive Layout

I only managed to make half of my layout responsive as I was concious of time. I struggled on recalling flexbox & other Display properties and completely understanding how to use them to achieve a specific outcome. My previous design had felt abit too complicated for the limited time to achieve realistically. However, I will be reverting back to this design in future with more complicated CSS and more understanding.
This is what I created before I removed it for the simpler layout:

### Hover Image Overlay

This was another that I attempted and wasn't able to, due to time and lack of understanding. I want to come back to this feature in future.

### Design Improvement

Due to my lack of understanding in Flexbox and Display, my original design in my wireframe wasn't responsive to screen size changes. This was disapointing as my original Idea was alot more complex and professional. I will update my layout in future.

### Logos, HandWritten Titles and Other

Something interesting that I had tried, was adding logos, a handwritten title and moving icons to my page. I had big ideas for a unique design and as an art student, I was desperate to fulfill a design that was ahead of my tool set. These are some more design features I want to bring to my portfolio, aswell as simply improving the code itself.

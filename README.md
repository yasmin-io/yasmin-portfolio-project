# Building a Portfolio: Advanced CSS

## Project Description

I wanted to build a portfolio page which will be used so that I can showcase my skills and talents I learned to future employers. We were supposed to start from scratch and no starter code was given. I was excited for this project as I got to express myself in
anyway I wanted to using the tools I had learnt.

> **Note:** I do not have enough web applications to showcase at this point. I will be using placeholder images instead and replacing the images and links in future. I didn't have enough time to complete my project to my fullest ability, which I will be putting some more time in to complete this project.

## Tasks

---

- Add a Name, Photo, Links to corresponding sections, My Work (placeholders) and a 'contact me' section.
- A Navigation bar. When clicking the links, the UI scrolls to corresponding sections. (My Work with titles, however I don't have any work to add as of yet.)
- One application should be larger than others
- Clicking on the images, It should take me to the application.
- The website should be responsive and adapt to the viewport.

### Responsive Layout

I only managed to make half of my layout responsive as I was concious of time. I set all the image sizes to the same size, as I was aware that this would have been simpler. And I did have a layout but didn't have the time to create all three different parts responsive and coherent.
This is what I created before I removed it for the simpler layout:
